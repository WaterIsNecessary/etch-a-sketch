# Etch-a-Sketch

This is a browser based sketchpad. It should allow you to create a pixelated 
trail by moving your mouse pointer over the squares contained within the 
sketchpad.

## To do list

- Create a better layout in regards to the header, sketchpad and footer. This 
would mean having the header and footer width extending across the screen as
well as the sketchpad and button being contained in their own div to control
their placement within this column format.

- Create a rainbow mode, opacity mode (incrementing in opacity by 10% each 
mouseover) and eraser mode.

- Create a slider for increasing or decreasing grid size

- Make grid work in an intuitive way on touch devices (possibly look into 
pointer events).
